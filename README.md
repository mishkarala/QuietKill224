# QuiteKill Module я епал как этот хэш сделать. эта штука не рабочая
 
QuiteKill is a KernelSU/Magisk module that force-stops background apps to free memory, save battery, and keep your device smooth. It can be triggered automatically when you lock your device using power button or controlled manually through a built-in WebUI.

## Features

- **Automatic App Killer**  
  A short tap of the power button instantly stops all running user apps.  

- **Ignore List**  
  Add package names of apps you want to keep alive. These apps will never be killed.  

- **System App Killer**  
  Pre-installed Google services on non-vanilla ROMs such as Photos, Gmail, Gdrive etc. are system apps and not killed by default. Add them to the Force Kill list if you want them stopped.  

- **WebUI Control Panel**  
  A clean and responsive interface to:  
  - Run the killer on demand  
  - View, filter, copy, and export logs  
  - Manage ignore and force-kill lists  
  - Monitor killed vs. skipped apps in real time  
  - Switch between light and dark themes  

- **Stop Trigger Option**  
  You can disable the power button trigger by clicking on the module's action button if you only want to run QuiteKill manually.


## Stop Logic

1. **User Apps** – All user-installed apps are killed by default  
2. **System Apps** – Only killed if explicitly added to the Force Kill list  
3. **Ignored Apps** – Always protected and never killed, regardless of trigger  

## Configuration
> PATH : /data/adb/modules/QuiteKill/config.txt
```
# Edit values as needed (0 = off, 1 = on)

# Kill multiple apps at the same time (faster)
PARALLEL=1

# Maximum number of apps to kill at the same time in parallel mode
MAX_JOBS=4

# Kill only apps that are currently running (1 = only running, 0 = all apps)
ONLY_RUNNING=1

# Skip critical system apps to avoid crashes (1 = skip, 0 = allow)
SKIP_CRITICAL=1

# Generate & save logs (1 = save, 0 = don't save)
VERBOSE=1

# Use wildcard patterns in ignore list (1 = enable, 0 = exact match only)
WILDCARD_IGNORE=0
```

## Installation

- Flash via Magisk, KernelSU, or Apatch  
- Reboot your device  
- Open the [WebUI](https://github.com/5ec1cff/KsuWebUIStandalone/releases) and configure the settings as per your needs


## Disclaimer

Force-stopping apps may affect notifications, background sync, and system stability.  
Use the ignore list for critical apps and be careful with the system kill list.
